### Project Description / Outline:

Determine if there is a relationship between a country’s happiness and its suicide rate

### Research Questions to Answer:

- Does GDP & Generosity correlate to happiness?
- What predictor has the closest correlation to happiness?
- What geo area is the happiest?

### Datasets to Be Used:

[World Happiness Data](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)

[Suicide Rates](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

- Figure out how to merge the two datasets together on ‘Country’
	- This will involve analyzing the datasets, and cleaning them in such a way so that they can be merged
- Clean data sheet for the year 2015
- Breakdown happiness factors and how they relate to happiness and / or suicide rates
- Visualize your data analysis
